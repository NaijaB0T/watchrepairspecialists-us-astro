Understanding the potential costs of watch repairs can help you budget for the maintenance of your timepiece. Here's a look at some of the most common repairs and their typical price ranges.

### Battery Replacement

- **Cost**: $10 - $60
- **Details**: This is one of the most frequent and affordable repairs. The cost can vary depending on the watch brand and whether a pressure test is needed to ensure water resistance.

### Crystal Replacement

- **Cost**: $50 - $300+
- **Details**: The watch crystal (the glass covering the dial) can get scratched or cracked. The cost depends on the material (acrylic, mineral, or sapphire) and the shape of the crystal. Sapphire crystals are the most expensive but also the most durable.

### Strap or Bracelet Repair/Replacement

- **Cost**: $20 - $500+
- **Details**: A simple pin replacement can be very inexpensive, while a new high-end leather strap or a custom metal bracelet can be quite costly. The price is highly dependent on the material and brand.

### Full Service / Overhaul

- **Cost**: $200 - $1,000+
- **Details**: A full service is a comprehensive maintenance procedure that involves disassembling, cleaning, lubricating, and reassembling the watch movement. This is recommended every 3-5 years. The cost varies widely based on the complexity of the watch and the brand. Luxury brands with in-house movements are typically at the higher end of the price range.

### Crown and Stem Repair

- **Cost**: $50 - $250
- **Details**: The crown (the knob used to set the time) and stem can get damaged from impacts or wear. This repair involves replacing these parts and ensuring they function correctly.

These prices are estimates and can vary based on your location, the watch brand, and the specific specialist you choose. It's always a good idea to get a quote before proceeding with any repair.
