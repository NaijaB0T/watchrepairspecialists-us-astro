Regular maintenance is essential to keep your watch running accurately and to preserve its value over time. Just like any complex piece of machinery, a watch requires periodic servicing to ensure all its components are in optimal condition.

### Why is Maintenance Important?

- **Longevity**: Routine servicing can significantly extend the life of your watch. Over time, lubricants can dry up, and seals can degrade, leading to increased friction and wear on the delicate internal parts.
- **Accuracy**: A well-maintained watch keeps more accurate time. As parts wear, the precision of the movement can be compromised.
- **Water Resistance**: For water-resistant watches, seals and gaskets need to be checked and replaced periodically to maintain their effectiveness.
- **Value Preservation**: A watch with a full service history is often more valuable to collectors and enthusiasts.

### What Does a Full Service Include?

A comprehensive watch service typically involves:
1.  **Disassembly**: The watch is completely taken apart.
2.  **Cleaning**: Each component is thoroughly cleaned in an ultrasonic bath.
3.  **Inspection**: Parts are inspected for wear and replaced if necessary.
4.  **Reassembly and Lubrication**: The movement is reassembled and lubricated with high-quality oils.
5.  **Timing and Regulation**: The watch's timing is adjusted for accuracy.
6.  **Case and Bracelet Refinishing**: The case and bracelet are polished to remove scratches.
7.  **Water Resistance Testing**: The watch is tested to ensure it meets its water resistance rating.

By investing in regular maintenance, you are not just taking care of a timepiece; you are preserving a piece of craftsmanship that can be passed down through generations.
