    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Factors Influencing Repair Costs:</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li><strong>Type of Watch:</strong> Luxury watches (e.g., Rolex, Omega) often have higher repair costs due to specialized movements, proprietary parts, and the need for certified watchmakers. Standard quartz watches are generally less expensive to repair.</li>
      <li><strong>Nature of Repair:</strong>
        <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
          <li><strong>Battery Replacement:</strong> One of the most common and least expensive repairs.</li>
          <li><strong>Strap/Band Replacement:</strong> Costs vary widely based on material (leather, metal, rubber) and brand.</li>
          <li><strong>Crystal Replacement:</strong> Depends on the type of crystal (mineral, sapphire) and whether it's flat or domed.</li>
          <li><strong>Movement Overhaul/Service:</strong> This is a comprehensive service involving disassembling, cleaning, lubricating, and reassembling the movement. It's one of the most expensive repairs but essential for mechanical watches every few years.</li>
          <li><strong>Water Damage Repair:</strong> Can be complex and costly, often requiring extensive cleaning and part replacement.</li>
          <li><strong>Vintage Watch Restoration:</strong> May involve sourcing rare parts and specialized techniques, leading to higher costs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Parts Availability:</strong> If original parts are hard to find, especially for vintage or obscure brands, the cost can increase due to sourcing efforts or the need for custom-made components.</li>
      <li><strong>Watchmaker's Expertise:</strong> Highly experienced and certified watchmakers, particularly those specializing in specific brands, may charge more for their services, reflecting their skill and precision.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Average Cost Ranges (Estimates):</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li><strong>Battery Replacement:</strong> $10 - $50 (can be higher for luxury brands requiring pressure testing)</li>
      <li><strong>Strap Replacement:</strong> $20 - $200+ (depending on material and brand)</li>
      <li><strong>Crystal Replacement:</strong> $50 - $300+ (depending on crystal type and watch complexity)</li>
      <li><strong>Basic Service (Quartz):</strong> $50 - $150</li>
