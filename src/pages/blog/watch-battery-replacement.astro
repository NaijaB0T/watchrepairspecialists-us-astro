    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
      Replacing a watch battery is a common and relatively simple procedure, but it's crucial to do it correctly to avoid damaging your timepiece. While some might attempt it themselves, professional replacement is often recommended, especially for water-resistant or valuable watches.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">When to Replace Your Watch Battery:</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li><strong>Watch Stops:</strong> The most obvious sign.</li>
      <li><strong>Intermittent Operation:</strong> The watch runs, then stops, then runs again.</li>
      <li><strong>Second Hand Jumps:</strong> Some quartz watches have an "end-of-life" (EOL) indicator where the second hand jumps every few seconds instead of sweeping or ticking normally.</li>
      <li><strong>Dim Digital Display:</strong> For digital watches, the display might become faint or incomplete.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Types of Watch Batteries:</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Most quartz watches use small, button-cell batteries. These are typically silver oxide batteries, but some may use lithium batteries, especially for watches with more functions (e.g., alarms, backlights).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Why Professional Replacement is Recommended:</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li><strong>Correct Battery Type:</strong> A professional will know the exact battery type and size required for your specific watch model.</li>
      <li><strong>Proper Tools:</strong> Opening a watch case requires specialized tools to prevent scratches or damage to the case back.</li>
      <li><strong>Gasket Inspection and Replacement:</strong> The water resistance of your watch depends on intact gaskets. A professional will inspect, clean, and replace worn gaskets, and apply silicone grease to ensure a proper seal.</li>
      <li><strong>Pressure Testing:</strong> For water-resistant watches, a professional will perform a pressure test after battery replacement to ensure the water resistance is maintained. This is crucial to prevent moisture damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> Watch movements are sensitive to dust and debris. A professional works in a clean environment to prevent particles from entering the watch.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoiding Damage:</strong> Incorrect handling can lead to damage to the movement, coil, or other delicate components.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">DIY vs. Professional:</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
      While it's possible to replace a battery yourself, especially for inexpensive, non-water-resistant watches, the risk of damage or compromising water resistance is high. For valuable watches, or any watch you wish to keep in good condition, professional battery replacement is a small investment that can save you from costly repairs down the line.
