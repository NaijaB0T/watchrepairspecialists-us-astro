      Proper care and maintenance can significantly extend the life and preserve the beauty of your watch. Whether you own a luxury timepiece or a daily wear watch, these tips will help you keep it in excellent condition.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">General Care:</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li><strong>Clean Regularly:</strong> Use a soft, lint-free cloth to wipe down your watch case and bracelet/strap regularly. For metal bracelets, a soft brush and mild soapy water can be used, but ensure the watch is water-resistant and dry it thoroughly.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Extreme Temperatures:</strong> Do not expose your watch to extreme heat or cold, as this can affect the lubricants in mechanical movements and the battery life in quartz watches.</li>
      <li><strong>Protect from Shocks:</strong> While many watches are designed to be durable, avoid dropping your watch or subjecting it to strong impacts, which can damage the movement or crystal.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep Away from Magnets:</strong> Strong magnetic fields (from speakers, refrigerators, or certain electronic devices) can magnetize mechanical watch movements, causing them to run inaccurately. If your watch becomes magnetized, a watchmaker can demagnetize it.</li>
      <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> When not wearing your watch, store it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. A watch box or a soft pouch is ideal to protect it from dust and scratches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Water Resistance:</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li><strong>Understand Ratings:</strong> Water resistance ratings (e.g., 30m, 50m, 100m) indicate the watch's ability to withstand water pressure, not depth. A 30m watch is splash-resistant, not suitable for swimming. Always check your watch's specific rating.</li>
      <li><strong>Check Gaskets:</strong> Gaskets and seals can degrade over time. Have your watch's water resistance checked annually by a professional, especially before swimming or diving.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Hot Water:</strong> Hot water, steam, and sudden temperature changes can cause gaskets to expand and contract, compromising water resistance. Avoid wearing your watch in hot showers, saunas, or hot tubs.</li>
      <li><strong>Ensure Crown is Pushed In:</strong> Always make sure the crown (and pushers, if any) are fully pushed in or screwed down before exposing your watch to water.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Servicing:</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li><strong>Regular Maintenance:</strong> Mechanical watches should be serviced every 3-5 years to clean, lubricate, and adjust the movement. Quartz watches also benefit from periodic checks, especially for battery changes and seal inspections.</li>
      <li><strong>Professional Repair:</strong> Always take your watch to a qualified watchmaker for any repairs or servicing. Attempting DIY repairs can cause further damage and void warranties.</li>
    </ul>
