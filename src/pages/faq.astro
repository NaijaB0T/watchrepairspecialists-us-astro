        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Is it worth repairing a watch?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          The decision to repair a watch often depends on its sentimental value, monetary worth, and the extent of the damage. For valuable or heirloom watches, repair is almost always worth it to preserve their history and functionality. For less expensive watches, it might be more cost-effective to replace them, but a repair can still be a good option if you have an attachment to the timepiece.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What is a watch repairer called?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          A watch repairer is typically called a horologist or a watchmaker. A horologist is a specialist in the science of measuring time, including the making of clocks, watches, and other time-measuring instruments. A watchmaker specifically focuses on the repair, maintenance, and creation of watches.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">How much to fix a watch strap?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          The cost to fix a watch strap varies widely depending on the type of strap (leather, metal, rubber), the brand of the watch, and the nature of the repair. Simple repairs like replacing a pin might be inexpensive, while a full strap replacement, especially for luxury brands or unique materials, can be significantly more. It's best to get a quote from a watch repair specialist.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What damages a watch?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Watches can be damaged by various factors, including water exposure (even "water-resistant" watches have limits), impacts or drops, extreme temperatures, magnetic fields, and lack of regular maintenance. Dust and dirt can also accumulate inside the movement, causing friction and wear over time. Chemical exposure from perfumes or cleaning agents can also damage the watch's exterior.
